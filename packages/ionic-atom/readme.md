Preview a live version of your [Ionic](http://www.ionicframework.com) application
in an atom pane.

## Getting Started

In your terminal:
```bash
apm install ionic-atom
ionic serve -b
```

Then hit `Cmd + Shift + P` in atom and use the command `Ionic: Preview`

(note: if you don't see `Ionic: Preview` in the list you may need to restart atom)

This will open a new pane with your app displayed in it.

## TODO
* Get a license up (go ahead and use it for whatever)
* Test on windows
* Auto-start the ionic server
* Better access to dev logs
* CONTRIBUTE.md
* Specs
